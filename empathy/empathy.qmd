**Objective:** Child maltreatment is a well-established risk factor for self-harm, yet the affective processes underlying this association remain unclear. This study examines how empathy relates to the association between early childhood maltreatment and lifetime self-harm thoughts.

**Method:** Data from 303 adults were stratified based on the presence or absence of maltreatment history in early childhood. Self-reports of lifetime self-harm thoughts in adulthood and empathy during adolescence were examined in both groups using generalized additive models to assess non-linear relationships. Models also controlled for respondents' age, gender, and socio-economic status.

**Results:** 

There was an interesting and complex pattern of results.

![overall results](overall.png){width=80%}

Adults with early childhood maltreatment history were more likely to report self-harm thoughts than those without the history (χ² = 14.87, p < .01).

A significant nonlinear association was observed between empathy and self-harm thoughts (edf = 2.14 χ² = 9.67, p = .02).

Predicted probabilities of self-harm thoughts were lowest at moderate levels of empathy for both groups. Risk for self-harm thoughts was highest among individuals with high empathy. Risk for self-harm thoughts was nearly as high for individuals with low empathy.

**Conclusion:** While a moderate level of empathy can be protective from early childhood maltreatment, both low and high levels of empathy were associated with a greater risk for self-harm thoughts. Findings suggest the need to further investigate the role of empathy as a “risky strength” among adults.
