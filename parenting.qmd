Parents raise their children in a variety of ways. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-positiveparenting" pan-to="0%,0%"  scale-by="1.1"}
The objective of this study was to test the associations between 11 caregiver aggressive and nonaggressive discipline behaviors and outcomes (aggression and prosocial peer relations) of children under 5 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). 
:::

Data came from the fourth (2009-2013) and fifth (2012-2017) rounds of the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-mymap" scale-by="1.25"}
Analyses were restricted to households with children under 5 years, leaving a sample of 229,465 respondents across 60 LMICs.
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-equation" scale-by="1"}
Data were analyzed using a statistical method known as Bayesian multilevel logistic regression.
:::

:::

:::{focus-on="cr-discipline"}
Different forms of discipline had different effects.
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-discipline-most-common"}
Verbal reasoning (80%) and shouting (66%) were the most common parental discipline behaviors toward young children.
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-discipline"}
Psychological and physical aggression had similar effects.
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-discipline2"}
Psychological and physical aggression were associated with higher child aggression. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-discipline3"}
Verbal reasoning was associated with lower aggression and higher prosocial peer relations. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-discipline4"}
Taking away privileges was associated with lower prosocial peer relations. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-mymap"}
Results indicated some country-level variation in the associations between parenting behaviors and child socio-emotional outcomes. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-discipline"}
However, the associations of discipline with child outcomes were still largely consistent across countries.

Psychological and physical aggression were disadvantageous for childrenâ€™s socio-emotional development across countries. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-positiveparenting" scale-by=".7"}
Only verbal reasoning was associated with positive child socio-emotional development.
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-positiveparenting" scale-by=".8"}
No form of psychological aggression or physical aggression benefited child socio-emotional development in any country.   
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-positiveparenting" scale-by=".9"}
Greater emphasis should be dedicated to reducing parental use of psychological and physical aggression across cultural contexts.
