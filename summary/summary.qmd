# Research Question

We began by setting out to examine the associations of *physical punishment* and *verbal reasoning* with *child development outcomes*.

A second research question was: Are the relationships between different types of parenting *consistent* around the world?

# Data 

To carry out our various research projects, we made use of the *Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys* (MICS) from UNICEF. 

The MICS surveys contain questions on parenting, and have been carried out in over 60 *Low and Middle Income Countries* (LMICs) around the world.
