# Introduction

Across the world, there is a great deal of suffering. Many people have mental health issues or substance use issues. People often suffer the after effects of discrimination, poverty, trauma, violence or conflict.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library(rnaturalearth) # natural earth data

library(ggplot2) # beautiful maps

library(dplyr) # data wrangling

library(sf) # simple (spatial) features

# library(patchwork) # stitch ggplots together

mapdata <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", # medium scale
                        returnclass = "sf") # as sf object

mymap <- ggplot(mapdata) + # the data I am mapping
  geom_sf() + # the geometry I am using
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

mymap + coord_sf(crs="+proj=robin") # Robinson projection

```

Understandably, many people and organizations try to develop *interventions* or *programs* for those who suffer from such difficulties. 

Yet evaluating such *programs* may be more difficult than it appears.

Let's consider a simple evaluation of a *program* designed to improve mental health.

In its simplest form, an evaluation might consist of looking at the outcomes--e.g. mental health outcomes--for those who participate in an *intervention*.

```{mermaid}

  intervention[intervention] --> outcome1[outcome]

  linkStyle 0 stroke:#000000,stroke-width:3px,font-size:36px,color:black;

```

However, we might wonder, or worry, about a number of issues. For example:

* What were the outcomes like for this group of people *before* they participated in the *intervention*?
* If the outcomes of the *intervention* were favorable, it might not be that the intervention is particularly better, but that people improve or get better *naturally* over time. 

Therefore a more sophisticated research design would be to have one group of people--an *intervention group*--participate in the *intervention* or *program*, while another group--a *comparison* group--does not participate. We would then compare outcomes across the two groups.[^ethics]

[^ethics]: Valid questions could be raised about the *ethics* of such an approach, specifically denying participation in the *program* to one group of people. If a program is of *unknown* benefit, it is *ethical* to evaluate this program with a comparison group approach, because it is *not yet known* whether the program confers benefit on its participants, and whether the program represents a valid use of time, energy and financial resources, or whether the program is a waste of resources, and of participant's time. Indeed, an evaluation might uncover the fact that the program has no beneficial effects, or even that the program is harmful! Once a program has been established as *beneficial*, it would likely be *unethical* to conduct an evaluation where the program is withheld from some participants. However, we could then consider a comparison of the program with an enhanced version of the program that might confer even more benefits.

  comparisongroup["comparison group"] ---> outcome0[outcome]

  linkStyle 0,1,2 stroke:#000000,stroke-width:3px,font-size:36px,color:black;

```

We hope that our results will show that those participants who have participated in the intervention group have better outcomes than those who were members of the comparison group.

```

One big question or concern in conducting an evaluation of this type is that our group of participants may be composed of different subgroups of individuals. These groups might be different in that they might repsresent individuals of different racial, ethnic or gender identities, might be people from different communities, or might have quite different sets of past experiences.

  subgraph study["study participants"]

  A["Group A: 100 people"]

  B["Group B: 100 people"]

  end

```

If participants from Group A and Group B are evenly distributed across the intervention and treatment groups, then we are not worried about the idea that an apparent effect of the intervention is because of unequal allocation of groups to the intervention.

```{mermaid}

config:
  look: handDrawn

flowchart LR

subgraph study["study participants"]

  A["Group A: 100 people"]

  B["Group B: 100 people"]

  end

  A --> |"roughly 50"| interventiongroup["intervention group"]

  B --> |"roughly 50"| interventiongroup["intervention group"]

  interventiongroup["intervention group"] --> intervention

  intervention[intervention] --> outcome1[outcome]

  A --> |"roughly 50"| comparisongroup

  B --> |"roughly 50"| comparisongroup

  comparisongroup["comparison group"] ---> outcome0[outcome]

  linkStyle 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 stroke:#000000,stroke-width:3px,font-size:14px,color:red;

```

One way of accomplishing this *even distribution* would be by randomly assigning participants to the intervention.

```{mermaid}

subgraph study["study participants"]

  A["Group A: 100 people"]

  B["Group B: 100 people"]

  end

  A --> |"roughly 50 RANDOMLY ASSIGNED"| interventiongroup["intervention group"]

  B --> |"roughly 50 RANDOMLY ASSIGNED"| interventiongroup["intervention group"]

  interventiongroup["intervention group"] --> intervention

  intervention[intervention] --> outcome1[outcome]

  A --> |"roughly 50 RANDOMLY ASSIGNED"| comparisongroup

  B --> |"roughly 50 RANDOMLY ASSIGNED"| comparisongroup

  comparisongroup["comparison group"] ---> outcome0[outcome]
