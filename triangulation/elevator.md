1. In the case of child physical abuse, there might be multiple reports from multiple sources. These multiple reports are often in agreement, but may sometimes conflict.
2. Sophisticated quantitative methods are helpful in reconciling or integrating sometimes diverging reports: the statistical techniques known as SEM and network analysis appear to be particularly helpful.
3. Self reports, particularly later self reports, appear to be the most predictive of the outcome of depression, but also the most correlated with (or representative of) the underlying construct of physical abuse. 
4. Self reports are also highly correlated with administrative reports. Parental reports are less correlated with these other two sources of reports.
