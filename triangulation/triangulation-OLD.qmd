# Background

The measurement of child maltreatment  has been a longstanding issue. 
:::

:::{focus-on="cr-multiple-measures"}
Information about child maltreatment can come from multiple sources. 

There may be discrepancies across administrative records, parent-reports, and self-reports. 

One proposed solution is "triangulation", or integrating data from multiple reporters and sources. 

However, it remains unclear how best to operationalize this concept.

:::{focus-on="cr-triangle"}
# Objective 

This study examines the concept of "triangulation" by employing different advanced analytic methods to determine whether these methods reveal a common underlying construct of physical abuse and whether they predict adult depression.

# Participants and Setting

Data come from the Lehigh Study, a 40+ year prospective study that began in the 1970s with children ages 18 months to 6 years of age. 

Data were collected in early childhood, middle childhood, adolescence, and adulthood (ages 36 and 46, on average).

# Methods

We applied five analytic approaches - network analysis, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, structural equation modeling (SEM), latent profile analysis (LPA), and a cumulative index regression - to assess the relationships among multiple reporters of childhood physical abuse and adult depression.

:::{focus-on="cr-SEM"}
# Results

SEM (structural equation modeling) best modeled the latent construct of physical abuse and significantly predicted adult depression. 

Adult self-reports played a particularly strong role.

Network analysis also highlighted strong intercorrelations among self-reports and meaningful links with depression.

# Conclusion

These findings highlight the usefulness of using advanced quantitative methods when presented with data from multiple reporters, along with the importance and validity of self-reports.
